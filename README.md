# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
All the homeworks and projects done at the university.

This are projects of different techniques of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analisys done as homeworks and in my spare time.
They are implemented in Python for the great libraries that exist in this language. My intention with this is that people can come and see
examples of a easy implementation of theses algorithms with the help of some Python libraries.
  Topics include:
  * Finite differentiation
  * Gradient Descent
  * Lineal Regression
  * Conjugated Gradient
  * Least Squares
  * Lineal Programming
  * Genetic algorithms
  * KMeans
  * KMeans nearest neighbour
  *ID3 Decision Tree
  * Logistic Regresion
  * Bayesian Net
  * etc.
